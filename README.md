# Titanic Fairness and Explainability Analysis

This project evaluates the fairness and explainability of a machine learning model trained on the Titanic dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Titanic survival dataset
- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Fairness Tool**: Fairlearn
- **Explainability Tools**: SHAP, LIME

We examine how the model behaves with respect to the sensitive attribute "Sex", and use interpretability tools to explain both global and local model decisions.
